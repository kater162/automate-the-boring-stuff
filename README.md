## Random notes
- When a variable is created on a for loop statment that variable can be used outside the loop.
  Look at guessTheNumber.py program for an example of it being used.

- Some of the if statements in these examples are kind of weird and with a few extra checks that I for now don't see the reason for it
  Looking at rpsGame.py has checks for all the possibilities for losing.
  I would have though that if the you have checked of ties and all the winning scenraios the only other possibility would be a loss.
  So a simple else should suffice.
